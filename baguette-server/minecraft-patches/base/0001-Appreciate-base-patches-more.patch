Subject: [PATCH] Appreciate base patches more

This is an example base patch.

To generate one like this you generally follow the same steps as creating feature patches but with a small caveat; for it to *actually* be rebuilt and saved as a base patch it HAS to be moved *BEFORE* the `baguette Base Patches` commit, which is used internaly as an empty marker commit which seperates the base patches from per-file patches.
An example way of adding a base patch would be:
1. Make your changes
2. Do `git commit` with your commit message
3. Use `git rebase -i base` and move the commit you just created before the `Base Patches` commit
4. Follow with `git rebase --continue`
5. And lastly rebuild))

Modifying already present base patches works the same way as modifying feature patches: by editing the relevant commit
Base patches benefit mostly forks which would for example want to pull other forks, for that they can use the base patches which are applied before the fork's file patches (and therefore features) to prepare a base for their fork to work on which would be nearly identical to just making that fork your primary upstream and that's just one of its benefits!

They can also be used the same way as in the upstream project (canvas) for involving changes that you wish to be made before your actual code changes so you can use per-file patches safely without worrying about patch clutter from changes that modify hundreds of files.
